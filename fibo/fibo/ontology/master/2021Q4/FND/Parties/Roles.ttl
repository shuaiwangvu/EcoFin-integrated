	dct:abstract "This ontology defines some high-level concepts of roles for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These concepts include the basic property whereby something has some role, along with the high-level concept of an agent in a role. The agent in role concept provides the basis for party in role concepts in the PartyRoles ontology and is framed as some entity defined specifically in respect to some role which it performs in some context.." ;

		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Roles/Roles.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
   (6) to combine Parties, Party Roles, and Roles in a single, new, Parties module.""" ,
		"The https://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20180801/Parties/Roles.rdf version of the ontology was modified to eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC." ,
		"The https://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20200201/Parties/Roles.rdf version of the ontology was modified to eliminate an unused Role class and hasRole property, which were confusing to users, and to eliminate circularities in remaining definitions."
