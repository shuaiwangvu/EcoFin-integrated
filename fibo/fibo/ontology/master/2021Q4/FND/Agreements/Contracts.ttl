	dct:abstract "This ontology defines concepts relating to contracts, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These include written contracts which are the concrete evidence of agreements between parties, along with verbal contracts. Contracts are further broken down into bilateral and transferable contracts, the latter being the basis for most financial instruments. Properties of contracts are also defined, in particular contractual terms and contract parties. These concepts all form the basis of concepts in the financial services industry, for example interest payment terms are a kind of contract terms set, and security holders are a kind of contract counterparty." ;

		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Agreements/Contracts.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.""" ,

The new party takes on the rights and obligations of the original party. The corresponding novation agreement must be signed by the transferor, the transferee, and the counterparty (the other contracting party). Novation is frequently used in mergers and acquisitions to replace any outstanding relationships or rights and obligations of the organization being subsumed with relationships or obligations of the acquiring entity. It is also commonly used with respect to loan rescheduling." ,
		"Novation is different from assignment in the following ways: (1) novation is a consensual transfer of contractual rights and obligations, while an assignment can transfer only obligations and does not require the consent of the benefiting party, and (2) novation terminates the original contract, but assignment does not."
