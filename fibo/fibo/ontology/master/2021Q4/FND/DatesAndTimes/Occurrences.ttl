		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/Occurrences/ version of this ontology was revised to eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC, and eliminate unnecessary complexity in restrictions." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/Occurrences/ version of this ontology was revised to eliminate the hasDescription property, which can easily supported using an annotation or isDescribedBy, depending on the situation, clarify the formal definition of occurrence kind, and correct circular and/or non-ISO 704 compliant definitions." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/Occurrences/ version of this ontology was revised to fix spelling errors." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/Occurrences/ version of this ontology was revised to make use of the new composite date type added to Financial Dates." ,
		"""This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification.  It is also needed to provide temporal relationships for Ownership and Control.

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

   * FinancialDates  -- financial Dates and Schedules
   * BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
   * Occurrences    -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them.  Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together."""
