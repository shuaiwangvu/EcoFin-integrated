		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to loosen the domain of the hasUnderlier property, which could be either an instrument or leg, refine the definition of Underlier and hasUnderlier based on recent work on swaps, add the definition of a contract for difference (CFD), simplify the contract party hierarchy where the subclasses of contract party do not add semantics, add the concepts of underlying asset valuation and calculation agent, which are needed for various derivatives (moved from forwards) and eliminate the language related to transactions as well as the distinction between an OTC contract and exchange-traded contract / listed security, given how blurry the lines are today, across derivatives." ,

This is not the same as a model of a cashflow which is a consequence of applying some legal term for payment of interest or principal, but is a commitment expressed in purely cashflow terms. Review this though. Payout terms include: Values - values can only go up or down; Static values are defined for limits and the like. i.e. Constraints (and direction) - this covers caps and floors - these are read upward or downward Conditionality Formula relations (Input and Output): - these are values - these may have a cap or a floor on them also - these also may have Multiplication - there is also fixed margin - may have addition or substraction between these Linearity in covered in the above Timing / expiry Observaton (not terms): Probability Sensitivity" ;
