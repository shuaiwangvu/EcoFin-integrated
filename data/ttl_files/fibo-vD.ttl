Conceptually, this measure can be arrived at by three separate means: as the sum of goods and services sold to final users, as the sum of income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services, and as the sum of the value added at each stage of production. Although these three ways of measuring GDP are conceptually the same, their calculation may not result in identical estimates of GDP because of differences in data sources, timing, and estimation techniques." , "GDP represents a valuation expressed in terms of the prices actually paid by the purchaser after all applicable taxes and subsidies." .

When you get into indemnification, then for instance if the product doesn't meet the investor's requirement such that if it doesn't get paid then the lender steps in and takes the hit for the loan - this is usually a precondition for securitizing (issuing) the loan in a pool. If the loan is not going to be sold on the secondary market there would be no need to indemnify that loan so this term would not apply. Indemnification is insurance for the investor, while the lender is the one providing that indemnification."@en .

Furthermore, especially in American English, the concepts of the state and the government may be used synonymously to refer to the person or group of people exercising authority over a politically organized territory." .

                "Unlike futures contracts (which are processed through a clearing firm), forward contracts are non-standardized. Further, the two parties must bear each other's credit risk, which is not the case with a futures contract. Also, since the contracts are not exchange traded, there is no mark-to-market requirement, which allows a buyer to avoid almost all capital outflow initially (though some counterparties might set collateral requirements). The forward price makes the forward contract have no value when the contract is written. However, if the value of the underlying commodity changes, the value of the forward contract becomes positive or negative, depending on the position held. Forwards are priced in a manner similar to futures. Like in the case of a futures contract, the first step in pricing a forward is to add the spot price to the cost of carry (interest forgone, convenience yield, storage costs and interest/dividend received on the underlying). Unlike a futures contract though, the price may also include a premium for counterparty credit risk, and the fact that there is not daily marking to market process to minimize default risk. If there is no allowance for these credit risks, then the forward price will equal the futures price."@en ;

Because of the evolving nature of online trading in a 24 hour world, every exchange has a method of calculating its official closing price, although that methodology changes from time to time.  They may also publish an adjusted closing price, which reflects changes to the price that reflect corporate actions and after hours trading that occur before the opening of the exchange on the following day. Understanding how the closing price is determined is important to ensure price comparability for a given security across exchanges."@en .

Rather, an autonomous thing in the sense meant here is something which may or may not be subject to controls and constraints but is self-actualizing in its behavior in response to any such constraints. Autonomous things may include human beings, organizations, software agents, robots and animals." , "Agents, then, can be software agents, hardware agents, firmware agents, robotic agents, human agents, and so on.  While software developers naturally think of IT systems as being constructed of only software agents, a combination of agent mechanisms might in fact be used from shop-floor manufacturing to warfare systems.  The definition incorporated herein must be sufficiently general to account for these and other uses, such as for describing people and organizations who participate in broader processes and systems, for FIBO, other OMG standards and usage, and in general.\n\nWhether or not you restrict your view of agents to the software variety, most agree that agents deployed for IT systems are not useful without the following three important properties:\n\n(1) Autonomous - an agent is capable of acting without direct external intervention.  Agents have some degree of control over their internal state and can act based on their own experiences. They can also possess their own set of internal responsibilities and processing that enable them to act without any external choreography.  When an agent acts on behalf of (or as a proxy for) some person or thing, its autonomy is expected to embody the goals and policies of the entity that it represents.\n\n(2) Interactive - an agent communicates with the environment and other agents. Agents are interactive entities because they are capable of exchanging rich forms of messages with other entities in their environment.  These messages can support requests for services and other kinds of resources, as well as event detection and notification.  They can be synchronous or asynchronous in nature.  The interaction can also be conversational in nature, such as negotiating contracts, marketplace-style bidding, or simply making a query.\n\n(3) Adaptive - an agent is capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment. Agents can react to messages and events and then respond appropriately.  Agents can be designed to make difficult decisions and even modify their behavior based on their experiences.  They can learn and evolve." ;

These may be specified individually but more commonly the Calculation event is the one scheduled according to this kind of parametric schedule, with the other dates specified as an offset to these. Here we have allowed for each of the related dates to be independently parametrically scheduled. The notional amount step schedule is a separate kind of schedule, with similar terms but without a period length. For calculation schedules (and possibly payments, resets), there is a different end date to the end /start of the period, since events may be specified as being on specific dates - this is where the Roll Convention comes in. This has the same basic concepts as the generic schedule shown as the parent to this. However, where the upper model has Date with various applicable sub types (known i.e. calendar, specified or determined). For example, an ISDA FpML schedule has a Specified Date (via a convention), and then has a date roll rule which is specified for the whole schedule and applies to each of the dates returned by the parametric specification of the schedule. It has: A schedule beginning and end; A set of regular repeating periods: the scheduled event takes place once per period; Optionally one or two stubs (one start and one end); these may be longer than the repeating period, or shorter. The precise parameters used are: Start of the overall Schedule period: Effective Date End of the overall Schedule period: Termination Date Start of first regular period: not specified (assume Effective Date?) Length of each regular period: Frequency (actually a duration) There are generally three ways in which the regular periods of a parametric schedule may be expressed: first plus last first plus period length last plus period length event date plus period length. In FpML, Roll events (the date that something rolls over from the value used in one period to the value used in the next) is defined in a Roll Convention, which may be a day of the month, a day of the week, or some published set of dates, typically the ISDA quarterly dates for these events. This is therefore the date within the regular period (before adjustments) when the event occurs. This is in addition so a date for the start or end of such a period. In general this applies to the Calculation Schedule (i.e. the event is the calculation event) with other dates specified relative to this, however in principle the other related events (payment and reset or refix) are specified relative to this. It is not immediately clear what specification of a date replaces the Roll event convention element when this happens." ;

        skos:editorialNote  "FpML has \"Syndicated Loan\". Assume this is the same thing. Review session notes (pre-OTC SMER): [From: Investopedia: Loan Participation Note] Review: 1. Add terms e.g. contractual terms for participation 2. Are there other types of Participation Note which allow for participation in other forms of Asset / Collateral? 3. Can these be traded or not? Definition suggests a bilateral contract. 14 July: The note is documentation. That is, this is evidence for the securirty. An underwriting document (?) is similar. Someone promises to issue the notes for you. This is similar to how debt securities begin life - the underwriter sets the limits on what you will pay fo rthe ssecurity, and of course the amount. Two step orocess of creating the security and then selling it. See Bond / Debt Issuance diagrams and models. (see diagram notes etc. here) Note = tradeability. Indicates that someone has made a commitment at large. Loan Participation Note is either the other end of the loan, or a way of participating in the loan facility. If the latter, it would be a way of documenting the loan facility in a way that you can freely trade it. The alternative (non LPN) would be different. Circles - trading groups - members of the circle. Have to tell the other members of the circle what's going on, and get their permission from the members of that circle before you can assign those rights to someone else. This would mark out the OTC variant of these things. Then: risk participany, who has no original participation, but (later) agrees to take all of your risk off you. So now we have something with a secondary market and something without. Which is which, and what are they called? Which is the one described in FpML (presumably OTC). Generally, if you document your commitment to lend money, then other members of hte syndicate also have a risk in that you might not stump up your obligations. This has implicatiojns for being able to make this a security. This differs from a bond, where there is no intervening credit facility, you just buyt the thing that way you have become the lender. So there remain some doubts about how a participation note works. There is an element of credit embedded against the purchaser of any such note that gave someone membership ofa syndicate. There are also two sets of words in play: - Syndicated Loan - Loan Participation Note. So one of these probably gives you membership of the syndicate, and the other just gives you participation in the loan. It is less likely that there is a secondary market in the note that gives you participationm in a syndicate (because of the credit risk) but in theory at least, it is possible to create an instrument for this. We just don't know if it exists."@en ;

The market rate this time is higher than the capped rate. You as the seller of the option will pay me thedifference bwteen the capped rate and the market reate. If the market rate is lower than the capped rate no one pays anything because I will not exercise my right to that capped rate. So no money changes hands at settlement. Then: capped Loan: What I would be paying would be interest at the market rate if the market rate is lower, but if the market rate is higher then I would pay interest at the capped rate. This is the difference between a cap as a loan or as a cash settled thing. These represent different kinds of contract: Non loan one: Cap talks of settlement being difference between the market rate and the strike rate. This is cash settled.

This is called the calculation amount as it is the notional amount minus the recovery, to get a final calculation amount. There is a formula behind this. The Calculation Amount is how the calculation is driven not what the actual payment amount is. Do we model the formula? Depends whether there is physical or cash settlement.

This is a method of providing investors with a relatively predictable repayment schedule, even though the underlying assets are nonamortizing. Controlled-amortization ABS resemble corporate bonds with a sinking fund. After a predetermined 'revolving' period during which only interest payments are made, these securities attempt to return principal to investors in a series of defined periodic payments that usually occur over less than a year. A risk inherent in this kind of ABS is an early amortization event. (See 'Early-Amortization Risk', on page 20.)" .

In the case of CDOs, these different types of debt are often referred to as 'tranches' or 'slices'. Each slice has a different maturity and risk associated with it. The higher the risk, the more the CDO pays. Further details: Collateralized Debt obligations are securitized interests in pools of - generally non-mortgage - assets. Assets - called collateral - usually comprise loans or debt instruments. A CDO may be called a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO) if it holds only loans or bonds, respectively. Investors bear the credit risk of the collateral.

Hence there is a secondary market in the Note, that is the piece of paper, which is the asset. If you sell the note, do you cease to be a syndicate member and the holder becomes one instead? No, syndicate membership is specific to the primary, creation of the instrument, in the same way as a bond issue takes place. What we don't know: whether the participation is freely negotiable, or has limited negotiability. What we think is that as a minimum it gives you rights to the interest and principal, but does not bring you into the facility as a whole. there are (separately) structures which allow you to buy ito the syndicate. These are called \"Pariticipations\". This would (presumably) give you access into new loans. For this piece of paper, if you are the holder of the note you would be part of the syndicate.

Investopedia explains Weighted Average Loan Age - WALA The weighted average age will change over time as some mortgages get paid off faster than others. Based on the issuer of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the WALA may be weighted on the remaining principal balance dollar figure, or the beginning notional value of the loan. The flip side of the WALA is the weighted average maturity (WAM), which is a dollar-weighted measure of the months remaining until the principal amounts are completely repaid on each loan in the pool."@en .

Those are now replaced with actual sub types of mortgage pool. Here are the original notes and definition that went with the enumerated list of pool types: \n\nThe type of pool for a pool backed security. Each of these pool types represents pools of mortgages that have conformed to certain standards (that change periodically) that make them \"conforming\" -- such as mortgage balance under a certain threshold, creditworthiness, loan-to-value, etc.\n\nFurther Notes:\nNon Agency signifies a tranched security, for which there will also be a Tranche Type for the security tranche itself. All other pool types are Agency pool types. \n\nList Populated from Cutter document Page 5. \n\nAdditional terms from Adept Advistory:\nUnder Agency mortgages, basically you have various types of pools under the various agencies. You have:\n-GNMA-I\n-GNMA-II\n-GNMA Platinum\n-FNMA \n-FHLMC\n-FHLMC Gold\nAs far as definitions:The simple definition is that each of these pool types represents pools of mortgages that have conformed to certain standards (that change periodically) that make them \"conforming\" -- such as mortgage balance under a certain threshold, creditworthiness, loan-to-value, etc. Also, GNMA is explicitly backed by the US government, while FNMA and FHLMC are only implicitly backed by the US government.

SMM basic measure monthly Basis CPR C? Prepayment Rate based on SMM annualised PSA based on CPR takes the COR and applies a curve to the rate of prepayments on the model. (%) e.g. 100% PSA is applied to model. 200% PSA implies x%CPR per month Tries to reflect how prepayments in a pool will accelerate and then burn out. This reflects the nature of a mortgage pool, elgl why people will prepay, refinance, address selection and so on i.e. local economy facts. so those will drop out of the pool and you are left with those who will not. that's why it levels off. So who originates these figures? Is it measured ongoing?: No . Used to determine a pricing speed when marketing the security to investors. So this is part of the primary market / issuance where there is marketing. These are the estimated figures as they will be at issue. PSA may also be used as triggers. 100 - 400% PSA band - if you go outside that band, may change payment behaviour of those classes. Defaults: measures or rate of default CDR conditional default rate (annual) MDR Monhtly default rate - like CPR = Rate over time. - both defined as Rates.

Usually, repos are for a fixed period of time, but open-ended deals are also possible. Reverse repo is a term used to describe the opposite side of a repo transaction. The party who sells and later repurchases a security is said to perform a repo. The other party - who purchases and later resells the security - is said to perform a reverse repo. While a repo functions like the sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, but the legal reality and the economic effect is that of a secured loan. This is a loan as the original owner retains the rights to the cashflows of the underlying security. Economically, the party purchasing the security makes funds available to the seller and holds the security as collateral. If the repurchased security pays a dividend, coupon or partial redemptions during the repo, the funds are returned to the original owner. The difference between the sale and repurchase prices paid for the security represent interest on the loan. Indeed, repos are quoted as interest rates. A repo always pays interest at maturity, i.e. there are no periodic interest payments."@en .

Futures are distinguished from generic forward contracts in that they contain standardized terms, trade on a formal exchange, are regulated by overseeing agencies, and are guaranteed by clearing houses. Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily.

Just like the price of anything at all, the Option Premium has two value components, one which can be determined (known as Value In Use when applied to products or services) and an element which is more subjective and reflects investor sentiment (for products and services this is the Value In Exchange). For Options, these are Intrinsic Value and Time Value respectively; that is, the intrinsic value can be calculated directly while the Time Value reflects the difference between this and the Premium. Additionally, statistical measures can be used to reduce the level of unknown in the Time Value. Time Value reduces to zero as exercise date approaches. Notes Origin:MB Draft"@en .

If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will also give such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require. (ii) Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist. If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i). Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other party&rsquo;s policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed. (iii) Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination Event. (iv) Right to Terminate. If:- (1) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or (2) an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party, either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions."@en .

It has shareholders with limited liability and its shares may not be offered to the general public, unlike those of public limited companies. Limited by shares means that the company has shareholders, and that the liability of the shareholders to creditors of the company is limited to the capital originally invested, i.e. the nominal value of the shares and any premium paid in return for the issue of the shares by the company. A shareholders personal assets are thereby protected in the event of the company's insolvency, but money invested in the company will be lost. A limited company may be private or public. A private limited companys disclosure requirements are lighter, but for this reason its shares may not be offered to the general public (and therefore cannot be traded on a public stock exchange). This is the major distinguishing feature between a private limited company and a public limited company. Most companies, particularly small companies, are private. Private companies limited by shares are required to have the suffix Limited (often written Ltd or Ltd.) or Incorporated (Inc.) as part of their name, though the latter cannot be used in the UK or the Republic of Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland, Teoranta (Teo.) may be used instead, largely by Gaeltacht companies. Cyfyngedig (Cyf.) may be used by Welsh companies in a similar fashion." ;

The size of this set is defined by a count.\n\nThe 'initial ScheduleStub' associated with a RegularSchedule identifies any special treatment applied before the recurrence start date.

Hence, the starting date could be relative to another Date (e.g. T+3) or triggered by the Occurrence of an OccurrenceKind, etc.\n\nThe recurrence start date can also be relative to the starting Date of the overall DatePeriod of the Schedule." .

The third (right-most) character of the identifier (alphabetic code) is an indicator derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund. If the currency is not associated with a single geographical entity as described in ISO 3166-1, typically a specially allocated identifier (alpha-2 code) is used to describe the currency authority. This code has been allocated by the Maintenance Agency from within the user-assigned range of codes XA to XZ specified in 8.1.3 of ISO 3166-1:2013. The character following X will be a mnemonic, where possible, derived from the name of the geographical area concerned." .

How this works is that you take the inflation rate when the security was issued, and the inflation rate at the present. The difference between these becomes the Factor, e.g. 100% -&gt; 101% gives 1% so for example for a $1000 issue - calculate the principal on which the interest is paid AND the principal from the point of view of how the principal is repaid. Some inflation bonds only do this on interest, some only on interest, but most apply it to the principal and interest. Coupon interest calculated based on the adjusted amount of the bond. so a fixed coupon rate is multiplied by e.g. 1010 in the example above. Variations e.g. Italy - daily published factor published for that bond, whereas other calculate based on underlying index. Typically a CPI or a statistical number generated by the govt. typically a lagging three month index. See UK bonds on this. US and Japanese ones - look at inflation rate 3 months prior. Unlike an Amortizing Security this principal value of the bond is increasing, whereas for and Amortizing, the principal is decreasing. In Canada, these are also referred to as \"real return bonds\". \nFurther Notes:Additional review with OTPP May 05 2010 indicates that this is part of a classification of bonds where the principal amount itself varies according to some index, a point which was not understood at the original review session. Terms and labels revised to fit this picture." ;

                "Where it refers to pre-payment above, if the bond does not include prepayment then this is not included. However, analytics that refer to this e.g. Yield to Average Life, then this figure is relevant. It is not relevant for other types of bond where e.g. you would use yield to next call, yield to worst etc. Average Life used in place of Maturity for Yield Calculation. This is not only used for Yield calculations though. It is referred to as an analytic figure in its own right. Average Life uses one of a number of standard pre-payment models (for structured finance at least). For MBS, the average life includes some calculations to take account of pre-payments on the underlying mortgages. This takes account of the possibillity of borrowers paying early. This has to be modeled or forecast (not given) as it's a function of market conditions and interest rate. You would not see this in a market data feed. When you model MBS you calculate Average Life as part of the model i.e. you estimate the percentage of prepayment in the next x length of time and factor this into the Average Life. Refers to Weighted Average Time to receipt of future cash flows. For MBS, early payments will shorten the Average Life. For Student Loans, Credit Card, Loan etc, i.e. all Pool Backed (any bond that has securitized debt). Other bonds: Sinking Funds etc., also Early Payment - partial Call for a corporate / regular bond. Early Payment for pass through has the same effect. Sinking Fund: Each payment is part principal and part interest, this is implicit in the overall definition of \"Early payment\"."@en .

The number will appear on an identity document issued by a country.\n\nThe ways in which such a system is implemented are dependent on the country, but in most cases, a citizen is issued an identification number at birth or when they reach a legal age (typically the age of 18). Non-citizens may be issued such numbers when they enter the country, or when granted a temporary or permanent residence permit.\n\nMany countries issued such numbers ostensibly for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States originally developed its Social Security number system as a means of disbursing Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become utilized for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car." ;

                "The standard methodology for a typical PPI is based on a Laspeyres price index with fixed quantities from an earlier base period. The construction of this index can be thought of in terms of selecting a basket of goods and services representative of base-period revenues, valuing this at base-period prices, and then repricing the same basket at current-period prices. The target PPI in this case is defined to be the ratio of these two revenues. Practicing statisticians use this methodology because it has at least three practical advantages. It is easily explained to the public, it can use often expensive and untimely weighting information from the date of the last (or an even earlier) survey or administrative source (rather than requiring sources of data for the current month), and it need not be revised if users accept the Laspeyres premise." , "Statistical agencies implement the Laspeyres index by putting it into price-relative (price change from the base period) and revenue-share (from the base period) format. In this form, the Laspeyres index can be written as the sum of base-period revenue shares of the items in the index times their corresponding price relatives. Statistical agency practice has introduced some approximations to the theoretical Laspeyres target due to a number of practical problems with producing the Laspeyres index exactly. For these and other pragmatic reasons, some agencies use alternatives depending on circumstances. See the IMF publication cited for a full explanation of the most commonly used approaches and trade-offs made for determining PPI." .

Accounts corresponding to securitized loans are typically referred to as the designated accounts (or sometimes trust accounts). The initial outstanding balances on the designated accounts are sold to the trust as are the rights to any new charges on the designated accounts. Subsequently, as cardholder purchase activity generates more receivables on the designated accounts, these new receivables are purchased by the trust from the originating institution/seller/transferor. The trust uses the monthly principal payments received from the cardholders to acquire these new charges or receivables. When the securitization is initially set up, the originating institution/seller adds sufficient receivables to support the principal balance of the certificates plus an additional amount (seller's interest) that serves to absorb fluctuations in the outstanding balance of the receivables. The originating institution/seller will make subsequent additions to the trust in order to keep the seller's interest at the required level."@en .

The holder of an ADR has the right to obtain the underlying foreign security that the ADR represents, but investors usually find it more convenient to own the ADR. The price of an ADR generally tracks the price of the foreign security in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of ADRs to foreign company shares. In the case of companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, creation of ADRs attracts a 1.5 percent creation fee; this creation fee is different than stamp duty reserve tax charge by the UK government.

Further notes: A measure of the change in price for a given change in Modified Duration. This always (necessarily) refers to Modified Duration. This is used as another risk measurement. Numerator is always (a) duration - either MacCaulays or Modified. Always rate of change of (one of the) Duration against some other parameter. The other paramater can be characterised as a Yield (it may be the Price, but that has a relationship to the Yield in any case). REVIEW: Inconsistency in the above - is it always necessarily Modified Duration that is referred to, or \"any\" Duration measure (Macaulays and.or Modified)? notes 9 Dec A measure of the sensitivity of the price with reference to interest rates. This is normally determined with reference to maturity, but since there are different maturity dates, this figure gives an estimate of the equitvalent if you had a homogenous portfolio, i.e. this is an estimate based on a pure equivalent, homogenous portfolio. Convexity of instrument versus portfolio. Sees instrument in terms of the set of cashflows. The term Convexity can be applied either to a bond or to a portfolio. More notes: When you get Convexit in MD, it will tell you what Duration it is refrfering to, along with Redemption Date (logically). Also if there is Option Adjusted Yield, there is a third set of analytics. What are they? i.e. OA Convexity, Duration Yield and the rest. Conclusions: Agreed to revisit this in OTC."@en ;

This is an incentive to complete the construction works. Notes from PoC reviews, discussing Maximum Balance concept: In a Construction Loan you agree a maximum amount that you could draw. As you progress with the construction you continue to draw more and more. So you start with the minimum. Example: for purpose of construction of a house you could need to borrow up to 500K and the bank establishes the milestones at which certain amounts are made availalbe and can be drawn. For instance prior to start you might draw 10%, (50K); the next 50K would be available to draw only once the foundations are laid. And so on. Milestones may include \"Frame standing\" (for American-style frame based houses). Each stage requires inspection on behalf of the bank. So you are starting with no more than 10% (in this example) of what is allowable, and could arrive to the full 500K by the end of ths construction but it is not mandated that you arrive to that. What differentiates a Construction Loan is that there si a max amount specified and there are Milestones specified in which the amounts for each milestone can be advanced."@en ;

Answers: You can pay the premium up front or in arrears (pre v pos tpaid) or you can pay it at any agreed time (indeed the time is already defined as terms see Payment Date), so this simply reflects that. Then there are other types of \"Participating OptionS\" where the anmount you pay depends on something else - so you don't pay the Premium up front. If it ends up outt of the money then you don't have to pay as much. So this is \"Variable\" premium. The alternative to this is \"Fixed\".

The issuing entity is normally a broker-dealer that owns common stock in the company. Because they're issued without the consent or cooperation of the foreign company, unsponsored ADRs generally trade over-the-counter (OTC)—rather than on a stock exchange. Also, shareholder benefits and voting rights may not be extended to the holders of these particular securities. Many large global corporations use unsponsored ADRs to attract American capital. For example, American investors can invest in Royal Mail PLC, a postal and delivery service company from the United Kingdom that was founded by Henry VIII.

To arrive at the WAM number the weight of each security is multiplied by the time until maturity of each mortgage, and then all the values are added together. For example say an MBS has three mortgages valued at $1,000, $2,000 and $3,000 (a total of $6,000) and mature in one, two and three years respectively. The weights of these are 1/6 (1,000/6,000), 1/3 (2,000/6,000) and 1/2 (3,000/6,000). The WAM is 2 1/3 years (1/6 x 1 year + 1/3 x 2 years + 1/2 x 3 years).

Certain category codes including those for very large businesses, such as airlines and some hotel chains, may be delineated to the point of identifying the business. Merchant category codes and/or the descriptions of the service categories are frequently used in credit card and other banking transactions for analysis, transaction classification, such as for use in promotional rewards, and sometimes tax-related purposes." .

        skos:editorialNote  "Arbitrage deals are motivated by the opportunity to add value by repackaging collateral into tranches. This is the same motivation for most CMOs. In finance, the law of one price suggests that the securities of a CDO should have the same market value as its underlying collateral. In practice, this is often not the case. Accordingly, a CDO can represent a theoretical arbitrage. april 28 note: Does this have meaning for Cash CDO? Are these always? Arbitrage is there to exploit market inefficiencies. Would there not be some arbitrage exploited in the CDO. The definition here implies cash CDO only. not cler to reviewers what the ditinctio nis and whether these are mutually excluive. On eview is that the arb CDO has cash inflorws different to cash outflows, e.g. 9.5% v 9% with the 50bp taken as fees. So that might be Arb CDO. There is another type we hav emissed: like an arb CDO where there is instead a spread between in/out as above, you have instead a MArket Value CDO, where its base don the market value of the deal. Not clear how you are supposed to realized that value. you are supposed to realize the xxxx of securities .Seen both referred to. So is arb a risk management tool."@en ;

This term is what we are referrring to when we refer to the credit event. This is what you are referencing to determine whether or not a default has occurred. Note: Loans as Reference Obligation: If the Ref Ob is a loan you can't establish that a default event has occurred but would have to specify some other event that can be obvserved to objectively determine that there has been a default. For example, you might have a loan for a company but monitor a bond issued by that company. If the bond defaults, the deliverable obligation may be the loan or some cash settlement based on the value of that loan (more typically). Detailed Review Notes: Q: Where does it go from here: thing or event? A: Commonly refers to an instrument, i.e. \"This is the instrument we are looking at; if this instrument defaults then we are going to pay out on the protection leg.

In its famous decision of SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 90 L.Ed. 1244, 66 S.Ct. 1100 (1946), the Court held that land sales contracts for citrus groves in Florida, coupled with warranty deeds for the land and a contract to service the land, were 'investment contracts' and thus securities. The Court stated that [a]n investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. 66 S.Ct. at 1103. According to the Court, it is immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise. 66 S.Ct. at 1104." .

So we make estimates of how face value will will change. face value won't change but the underlying value of the Pf changes, so eg. the current mortgage factor. Model update note June 2010: Detailed types of \"Prepayment Speed\" analytic received from thomson Reuters, now modeled as sub types of this term.

A bank acts as a middleman between suppliers of funds and users of funds, substituting its own credit judgement for that of the ultimate suppliers of funds, collecting those funds from three sources: checking accounts, savings and time deposits; short-term borrowings from other banks; and equity capital. A bank earns money by reinvesting these funds in longer-term assets." .

For example, let's say you have a deal with a PAC tranche and a support tranche (i.e., a tranche that is a support tranche and is therefore subordinate to the PAC tranche) that has a scheduled payment structure like you did with the PAC bond. That support bond then is called the PAC-2 bond. If you continue, and create another support tranche that also has scheduled payments, that would become the PAC-3 bond.

When a lender takes a loan which is a where the value of the loan is greater than 80% of the value of the property, at that point it is required for the lender to also get a private mortgage insurance, so they are paying separately for the mortgage insurance so that if the borrower defaults above 80% then the mortgage insurance pays the loss. In the Loan Party Insurer (new \"Party\" type) you have Loan Party Insured Ratio (e.g. the 80% in the example above). These are different situations but the same principle. So this needs to be modeled for both. 30 June: Is this Lender or Borrower? since you have one lender and one borrower in a single loan, but multiple lenders in the case of packaging this up for a security - there are then multiple lenders and multiple borrowers. A similar kind of insurance exists in the one lender one borrower scenario i.e. the mortgage loan itself. There are two concepts here. the MIG thing was for bundling these. the MIG might apply across multiple contracts, but still be a fact about \"the\" contract?

Usually the terms are set already at the fund level, and won't vary at share class level between different share classes, but they are facts about the share classes / Notes / Bonds i.e. what you can trade. In fact this happens already - different kinds of investors may have different settlement dates. In this example you announce it earlier - not the same. This may be a separate fact.

A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items - finding a single 'figure of merit' for these items - when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful 'average' to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5)." .

Clearing relates to identifying the obligations of both parties on either side of a transaction. Settlement occurs when the final transfer of securities and funds occur.\n\nCCPs benefit both parties in a transaction because they bear most of the credit risk. If two individuals deal with one another, the buyer bears the credit risk of the seller, and vice versa. When a CCP is used the credit risk that is held against both buyer and seller is coming from the CCP, which in all likelihood is much less than in the previous situation." .

Answers: This is the \"other\" side of the swap from credit protection, i.e. the payment side. You are going to pay a set of fixed payments in return for a payment that occurs in the event of the credit event. So this is not incorrect but not a useful name for it. Swap is swap of a set of payments that equates the credit margin in return for the payments that apply in the case of the credit event. Conclusions: A good name for it might be the Credit Margin, at least from the point of view of the protection buyer, as this is the margin they are paying for the credit protection."@en ;

Companies usually do not alter their objectives once they are implemented, unless changes in circumstances arise. Setting a clear course for the organization is key to its success." , "In general, objectives are more specific and easier to measure than goals. Objectives are basic tools that underlie all planning and strategic activities. They serve as the basis for creating policy and evaluating performance. Some examples of business objectives include minimizing expenses, expanding internationally, or making a profit." .
