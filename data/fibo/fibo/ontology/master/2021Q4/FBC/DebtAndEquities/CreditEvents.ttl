	dct:abstract """This ontology defines a range of credit events, that is events in which some payment or payments are not made. These include credit events relating to a specific debt obligation and events relating to the business entity as a whole. 
		Note: the events defined herein are primarily business rather than consumer oriented, and are specified fairly generally.  Many credit events are jurisdiction-specific, such as Chapter 11 restructuring and Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States.  This ontology is designed to facilitate jurisdiction and instrument-specific extensions as needed.""" ;
