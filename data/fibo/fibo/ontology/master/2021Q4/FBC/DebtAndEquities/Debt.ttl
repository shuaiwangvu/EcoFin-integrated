		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to add several common day count conventions used to calculate the amount of accrued interest or the present value when the next coupon payment is less than a full coupon period away, to support collateral agreements such as deeds of trust, UCC filings and the like, to add the concept of a rate reset time of day, to eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC, to simplify addresses, and to merge countries with locations." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to make redemption provision a child of contractual commitment and move it to financial instruments, as such provisions apply to preferred shares and other instruments in addition to debt." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to move the concept of an extension provision from Debt to Contracts to support representation of preferred shares and other extendable contracts, eliminate remaining circular definitions, integrate concepts defining credit facilities, and refine the concept of collateral to differentiate collateral that is real property from financial assets such as cash, various accounts, securities, and receivables." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/DebtAndEquities/Debt/ version of this ontology was modified to use the generic statistical measures and measurements now in FND."
