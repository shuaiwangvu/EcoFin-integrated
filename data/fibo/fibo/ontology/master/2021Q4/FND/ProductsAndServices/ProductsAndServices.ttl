Energy, such as electricity, is also considered to be a good from a legal perspective, and meets the criteria of being manufactured or produced via some process, including but not limited to a mining process. According to the UN Convention On Contract For The International Sale Of Goods, the term 'good' does not include (1) items bought for personal use, (2) items bought at an auction or foreclosure sale, (3) aircraft or ocean-going vessels." ,
		"From the Universal Commercial Code (UCC) in the United States, the term 'good' includes (i) fixtures, (ii) standing timber that is to be cut and removed under a conveyance or contract for sale, (iii) the unborn young of animals, (iv) crops grown, growing, or to be grown, even if the crops are produced on trees, vines, or bushes, and (v) manufactured homes. The term also includes a computer program embedded in goods and any supporting information provided in connection with a transaction relating to the program if (i) the program is associated with the goods in such a manner that it customarily is considered part of the goods, or (ii) by becoming the owner of the goods, a person acquires a right to use the program in connection with the goods. The term does not include a computer program embedded in goods that consist solely of the medium in which the program is embedded. The term also does not include accounts, chattel paper, commercial tort claims, deposit accounts, documents, general intangibles, instruments, investment property, letter-of-credit rights, letters of credit, money, or oil, gas, or other minerals before extraction."
