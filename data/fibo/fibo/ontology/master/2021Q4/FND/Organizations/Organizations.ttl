		"The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20160201/Organizations/Organizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC, to revise the definition of Organization per ISO 6523." ,
		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Organizations/Organizations.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.""" ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/Organizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/Organizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.1 RTF report, to revise a restriction on Organization to reference PhysicalAddress (vs. PostalAddress)." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/Organizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to allow the Organizations ontology to import Parties, rather than the other way around, to simplify the class hierarchy for ease of use in data mapping and alignment, including moving OrganizationMember from Parties to Organizations, and to add the basis for structured organization name representation." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/Organizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to reflect the merge of Goals and Objectives." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/Organizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to revise the definition of Organization to broaden its scope to individuals that may or may not be people and eliminate duplication with concepts in LCC." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/Organizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to to move basic organization sub-unit and identifier definitions to FND from BE due to their fundamental nature and reusability and add links to the W3C organization ontology to provide hints as to which classes in this ontology map to the W3C ontology. Note that mappings are approximate and thus we used seeAlso rather than OWL equivalence relations."
