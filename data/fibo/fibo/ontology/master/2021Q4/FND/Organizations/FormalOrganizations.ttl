		"The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20141101/Organizations/FormalOrganizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC to integrate concepts from LCC." ,
		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Organizations/FormalOrganizations.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.""" ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/FormalOrganizations.rdf version of this ontology was revised to loosen the constraints on the range of isDomiciledIn, allow for multiple values, update definitions to be ISO 704 compliant, and eliminate duplication with concepts in LCC."

It is also typically the legal home of a corporation because the place is considered by law as the centre of corporate affairs. In cases where a business has incorporated in one location for convenience, such as for taxation, legal, or regulatory purposes, but operates primarily in one or more other locations, domicile in FIBO refers to the operational location(s) rather than legal location.  Many companies in the US have incorporated in the State of Delaware, for example, but do not have operational facilities in Delaware (or only have small offices there)." ;
