		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.""" ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to add definitions for tangible and intangible asset, etc., as needed for refinement of the concept of collateral and other loan-specific concepts." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to better align with revisions to the situation lattice." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to integrate the concept of a situation, situational roles, and corresponding relations with the definition of ownership, and eliminate minimum cardinality of 1 in restrictions." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/OwnershipAndControl/Ownership.rdf version of the ontology was modified to reflect the move of hasAquisitionDate from relations to financial dates and eliminate circular definitions."
