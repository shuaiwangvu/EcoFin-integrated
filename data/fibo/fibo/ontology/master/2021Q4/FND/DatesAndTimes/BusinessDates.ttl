		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates/ version of this ontology was revised by the FIBO FND 1.2 RTF in order to add definitions for business recurrence intervals such as the day of the month and week, and to revise the representation of the end of the month to correspond to the way that the other intervals are represented for use in parametric schedules." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates/ version of this ontology was revised to better support definitions related to business day adjustments." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates/ version of this ontology was revised to eliminate a remaining circular definition." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates/ version of this ontology was revised to loosen domains on properties related to business day and day count (recurrence interval) conventions, eliminate a duplicate individual, normalize definitions to be ISO 704 compliant, eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC, move hasBusinessCenter to locations, where the class BusinessCenter is defined and merge countries with locations." ,
		"""This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification.  It is also needed to provide temporal relationships for Ownership and Control.

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

   * FinancialDates  -- financial Dates and Schedules
   * BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
   * Occurrences    -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them.  Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together."""
