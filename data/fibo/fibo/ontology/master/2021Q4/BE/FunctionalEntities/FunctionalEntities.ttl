Criteria for establishing a new category code includes (a) the merchant category is reasonable and substantially different from all other merchant categories currently represented in the list of code values; (b) the merchant category is separate and distinct from all other industries currently represented in the list of code values; (c) the proposal describes a merchant category or industry, and not a process; (d) the minimum annual sales volume of merchants included in the merchant category, taken as a whole, is USD 10 million; and (e) sufficient justification for the addition of a new code value is found."
